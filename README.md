#openGamification

This is a Generic Open Source Gamification Framework

It is not only designed as a part of a bachelor thesis to prove the concepts of gamification but also to be  driven even further. Giving points to the User is not the only thing you can do. But see yourself ...

##Goal

The goal is simple: Unification and simplification of gamification concepts to make them available for everyone without writing the whole thing.
